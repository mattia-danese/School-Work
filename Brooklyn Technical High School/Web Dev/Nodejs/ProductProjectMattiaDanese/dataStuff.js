fifaOP = ["1. This game is a blast to play!! the only downside is the gameplay. Its very hard to recreate your favorite goals and the players don't feel as fluid as normal. Other than that the game is great! Would totally recommend! RATE=5","2. Horrible passing system, defense/goalie reactions are awful, Fifa has not been good since fifa 15. RATE=1","3. Defending is broken. Bakayoko is apparently as fast as aubaumeyang. Some days you play amazing. Other days your playing terrible?? RATE=1","4. Fun game to play with family and friends!! RATE=5"];
codOP = ["1. there's no originality for this game, so don't buy it. RATE=1","2. I have been waiting for Call Duty to get back to WWII ever since black ops. I'm tired of this future stuff. RATE=4","3. Campaign is why I bought it and it was really good and immersive. RATE=5","4. This game is alright, the HQ is lazy and multiplayer is a little meh but overall, a good game. RATE=3"];
nbaOP = ["1. Great Graphics, great gameplay, variety of game modes, just overall a great game. RATE=5","2. I have played every NBA2K game and this one has shown that 2K has gone down the toliet. The new shooting meter is trash, gameplay and shooting percentage is awful, no NBA pros are as bad aas these players. VC hard to earn and expensive to get. I returned this game and wuill never play again. RATE=1","3. Easily the best basketball video game in the world. But it's very addicting. RATE=5","4. The game was not as exciting as I thought it would be. RATE=3"];
mineOP = ["1. Its a very good game and good for kids who are creative and have a good imagination. RATE=5","2. I got super bored after playing this game just bad. RATE=2","3. This game is so much fun. You can create anything you want. The possibilities are endless. Definitely worth the $27 price. RATE=5","4. This game is so bad it should be removed from existence just because it is so terrible Minecraft died out like 2 years ago. RATE=1"];
